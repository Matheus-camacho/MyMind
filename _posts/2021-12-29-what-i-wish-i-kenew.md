Inspired by Morgan Housel’s most recent post [(link)](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/i-have-a-few-questions/) and taking advantage of my New Year’s review and planning (this time I’ll stick to those….)  I want to share some of the questions I want to explore in the near future and think some people might benefit from.

- It’s easy to get stuck facing dead ends at work and life. How do I get better at identifying them?
-  Is unconditional love possible? Is it healthy?
- How can I better understand people that come from completely different worlds from me? 
- Are the most privileged really more privileged? Is some people’s grass actually greener?
- What is more important for innovation? A wide and varied knowledge or deep expertise?
- How do I keep my brain at peak performance for longer? 
- How many people have I missed the chance of loving just because they said something once wrong?
